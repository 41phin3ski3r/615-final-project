# 615-final-project

Complete code to download and clean a list of weather stations in the US states of Utah, Idaho, Colorado and Wyoming for years 1995-2020.  There is also script on kriging your data, which while it did not fit this situation properly, it can be reused for other smaller areas that would be better suited.  Finally there is also code to subset the data and test a hypothesis regarding the distribution of snowfall in the four states at various points in the winter


I was unable to upload my files due to the 25MB size limitations, So I have included a link to a google drive folder containing all of the output files:
